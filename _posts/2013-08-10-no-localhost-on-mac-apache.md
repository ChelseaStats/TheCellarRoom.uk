Setting up a development environment on your Mac? Most users use MAMP but it's not necessary as Mac OS X had apache and PHP built in. 

However if you cannot get localhost to work put can ping 127.0.0.1 check your Sites folder or any folder you set as your root has the logs folder. This took a couple of ours on stackoverflow and google to figure this out.
