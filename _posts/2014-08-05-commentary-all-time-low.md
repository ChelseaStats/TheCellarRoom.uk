Interesting thoughts, Sports commentary in the UK is at an all time low for me. We've had enough of Mark Lawrenson making
jokes at the expense of other players likening an American player's hair to a homelessman in the World Cup. Insightfully 
telling us he once sat next to someone who looked like a footballer on a flight to a game once.

Or Maybe it's Andy Townsend who has 'done everything right there', 'in and around' his box. 'Not for me, Clive'.

Not for me indeed.

The 2014-15 season starts soon, but you won't hear it. It'll be muted.
