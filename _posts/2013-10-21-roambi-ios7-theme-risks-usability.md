Roambi released an update to their iOS app over the weekend that coincides with a restyling of their website and logo.

The changes are generally ok, but switching to iOS 7 themes throughout because you can, or because others have, or because it's the new thing comes with its own risks.

Going flat and minimalist can be effective but it can also leave your customers confused and could ruin usability.
