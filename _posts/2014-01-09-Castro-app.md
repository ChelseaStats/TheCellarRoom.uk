> Castro is not dependent on new sales to continue operating because there are no server costs. 
This app will continue to work in the future as it does today. Customers pay for the app itself, 
not for a backend web service or monthly server fees. Castro is a rare example of an app that 
naturally fits the App Store pricing model.

That's the sort of thing that makes this wonderful

Moving from the core iOS podcast app was as easy as exporting the OPML in iTunes and importing it into Castro

But actually i just searched for the <a href="https://raw2.github.com/kutf/Apple/master/Podcasts.md">podcasts i listen to and subscribed.</a>
