We’re making this switch because we want:

+ users to have a choice about the software they use to read government documents

+ people working in government to be able to share their work more easily (we think sharing is a good thing: one of our design principles is “Make things open, it makes them better”)

+ to make it easier and cheaper to do business with government (no-one should have to pay for specialist software just to send us some information)
