We have soft launched a new website hosted on github and made with Jekyll/Ruby. The site aims to be a short form blog and 'planet' site for independant bloggers/writers who write about Chelsea FC. 

The site will publish links and snippets to content written off site and post short form blogs for writers without their own site.

you can find the site at TheChels.me in the near future.
